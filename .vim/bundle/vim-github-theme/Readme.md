# Github color scheme for ViM
This is a GitHub theme for ViM.
The basic colors are defined, but I'm sure it can be improved.

## this is a fork
from: https://github.com/nono/github_vim_theme
Some patches were added from commits on another forks.

## Installing with pathogen
```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/ricardovaleriano/vim-github-theme.git
```

## Installing manually
To use, copy github.vim to ~/.vim/colors and use :colo github in ViM.
